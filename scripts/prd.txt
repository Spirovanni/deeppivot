# Technical Architecture  
## Frontend  
- Next.js 15 (App Router)  
- React 19 + Tailwind 4.1  
- Zustand + React Query state/data  
- Shadcn UI component library with animation presets

## Backend  
- API Routes + Neon Postgres via DrizzleORM  
- Supabase for real-time data + file storage  
- Inngest for background processing  
- Better Auth for login / social auth  
- Polar for billing

## AI/ML  
- GPT-4 Turbo + Claude-3 Opus (LLM orchestration)  
- Deepgram for transcription  
- ElevenLabs / PlayHT for TTS  
- Hume AI for voice tone & emotion inference  
- OpenAI Embeddings for search  
- Custom BERT model for archetyping

## Data Models (DrizzleORM – TypeScript)  
```
users, user_profiles, interviews, interview_feedback,
career_plans, subscriptions, agent_config,
recording_url, transcript_url, archetypes, goals,
emotional_analysis
```

## Infrastructure / DevOps  
- Vercel + Cloudflare CDN deployments  
- GitHub Actions CI/CD with Node.js 20 runtime  
- Axiom, PostHog, Sentry for logs & monitoring  
- Global replicas: Salesforce + Supabase

# Development Roadmap  
1. **Phase 1 – MVP**  
   - Voice interviews  
   - Auth, billing, base career plan builder
2. **Phase 2 – Ecosystem Connect**  
   - WDB & Alt-Ed API integrations  
   - Mentor / coach marketplace
3. **Phase 3 – Intelligence Layer**  
   - Adaptive feedback  
   - Predictive career analytics
4. **Phase 4 – Scale**  
   - Mobile app  
   - White-label employer version

# Logical Dependency Chain  
1. Foundation: Auth → Database schemas → Voice interview core  
2. Visible MVP: Frontend interview UI + feedback loop  
3. Career plan builder tying interview results → plans  
4. Ecosystem APIs (WDB, Alt-Ed)  
5. Mentor marketplace  
6. Intelligence layer enhancements  
7. Mobile/White-label scaling

# Risks and Mitigations  
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| PII leakage in training data | Strip PII, use anonymization pipeline |
| Model bias in archetyping | Bias detection checks + human review |
| Latency >800 ms in interviews | Edge deployments, WebRTC tuning |
| Emotion inference fallback | Provide text-only feedback when Hume fails |
| Concurrency (>10 K users) | Horizontal scaling with serverless & CDN |
| RBAC violations | Strict role-based permissions (user, mentor, admin, WDB, enterprise) |

# Appendix  
## KPIs  
- 75 % interview completion rate  
- 60 % plan activation after 7 days  
- 30 % WDB connection rate  
- 10 K concurrent users supported  
- <200 ms API p95 response time

## Environment Variables
